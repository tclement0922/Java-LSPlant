# Java-LSPlant

[![Android CI](https://github.com/tclement0922/Java-LSPlant/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/tclement0922/Java-LSPlant/actions/workflows/android.yml)

An unofficial Java implementation of the LSPlant hooking framework.

The aim of this library is providing a easier way to use the LSPlant framework, without the need to 
provide an ART symbol resolver and a inline hook framework.

### Support
Java-LSPlant has the same support as LSPlant:
> Support Android 5.0 - 13 (API level 21 - 33)
> 
> Support armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86-64

Compatibility isn't guaranteed for every device. Some OEM system modifications, abis or something
else can break LSPlant, so if you plan to publish an app using this framework, do not forget to
support the case where `LSPlant.isInitialized()` returns false.
